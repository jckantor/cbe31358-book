# 
# Joaquim Gromicho, 2021
# 
# This notebook is part of the module Applied Optimization of the Analytics Academy's Data Science Essentials.
# 
# ---
#  > During this course we make use of Jupyter notebooks hosted by [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). 
#   Notebooks deployed on `colab` require neither python nor other dependencies to be installed on your own machine, you only need a browser (preferably `chrome`) and you may also need a google account if you want to execute them. 
#  
# ---
# 
# This training consists of a series of self-contained stories. 
# 
# This whole series makes use of [pyomo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyomo) which is the most complete and versatile Mathematical Optimization package in the python ecosystem.
# 
# The notebooks used in this course make extensive use of [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) of which [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) you may find a very comprehensive summary. May you like a document that you can print, fold, and take with you then you may like to check [this](https://enterprise.github.com/downloads/en/markdown-cheatsheet.pdf).
# 
# We also draw pictures on our notebooks. Therefore, we need the [magic](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html) below. 
#

# For this notebook we need the following packages:
#  * sympy
#  * math
#  * matplotlib 
#  * IPython
#  * pyomo 
#  * ipopt
# 
# If your python distribution is Anaconda, then from the above only the last two are likely not yet to be part of your local python installation.
# You need to install those packages on the anaconda prompt. As usual, you should try first with `conda install` and if that does not work then with `pip install`.
# You can try the conda distribution as explained in:
# https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyomo
# https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ipopt 
# For pyomo please read http://www.pyomo.org/installation and doe ipopt please refer to https://pypi.org/project/ipopt/ 
# 
# 

# ## About being pythonic
# 
# If you program, then reading [this](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/) will help you writing code that feels _natural_ in python. You may also like to uncomment the following statement for some introspection ðŸ˜‰

# import this


# ## Dependencies
# 
# The `import` statement on the cell above is special... it imports programmer's wisdom!
# The common usage is to acquire access to python packages.

# # Alice: a romantic introduction to Matematical Optimization and to Python
# 
# Note: this story was originally told in the book [Optimization](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691102870/optimization) and the protagonist there is called Samantha, but we stick to the alphabetical order...

# 
# As the story goes, Alice receives a beautiful rose.
# She has nothing but a lemonade glass to hold the rose and becomes very distressed when the ensemble falls down. 
# 
# Adding a bit of water helps! Not only that helps the rose, but it also helps the stability: glass, with some water, and rose stands!
# 
# Alice thinks: if a bit of water helps, the let us fill the glass! 
# 
# However, it tilts and falls, as in the beginning, just much more wet. 
# 
# Alice has a problem to solve: what is the _optimal_ level of water for her rose on a lemonade glass?
# 
# She learns from [Archimedes]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes) how to compute the _center of gravity_ of the glass with water, which has height
# $h = \frac{m_w}{m_w+m_g} h_w + \frac{m_g}{m_w+m_g} h_g$ with:
# 
# * $m_w$ the mass of water 
# * $m_g$ the mass of glass
# * $h_w$ the height of the center of gravity of the water in the glass
# * $h_g$ the height of the center of gravity of the glass without water 
# 
# Since Alice's glass is $20$ cm tall, $4$ cm wide and weighs $100$ gram, Alice may fill the glass with water up to height $x$ cm, provided that $0 \leq x \leq 20$ since the water must fit in the glass.
# 
# The volume of water is $\pi r^2 x$ with $r$ the radius of the base, i.e. $r=2$. 
# The volume is therefore $4\pi x$ cubic centimetres. 
# 
# Since the density of water can be [taken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram_per_cubic_centimetre) as being $1$ gram per cubic centimeter we have:
# 
# * $m_w = 4\pi x$
# * $m_g = 100$
# * $h_w = \frac{x}{2}$
# * $h_g = \frac{20}{2} = 10$ 
# 
# And from here we finally obtain the following formula for the height of the center of gravity of the glass with water:
# 
# $$
# h = \frac{4\pi x}{4\pi x + 100} \frac{x}{2} + \frac{100}{4\pi x + 100} 10 = \frac{4\pi x^2 + 2000}{8\pi x + 200}
# $$
# 
# Alice's problem is therefore:
# 
# $$
# \begin{array}{rl}
# \min    & \frac{4\pi x^2 + 2000}{8\pi x + 200}  \\
# s.t.    & x \geq 0   \\
#         & x \leq 20  \\
# \end{array}
# $$

# # Analytical solution
# 
# Alice learns from [Fermat]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Fermat) that for a function to reach its highest and lowest points inside its domain the derivative must vanish. 
# 
# This is a good moment to play with symbolic mathematics in python, we will use [sympy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html).

# ## With $\pi$ as a number

# In[ ]:


# x is a symbol and pi is a number
x  = sympy.Symbol('x')
pi = math.pi

# h is a function of x, and hprime its derivative 
h      = (4*pi*x**2 + 2000)/(8*pi*x+200)
hprime = sympy.diff( h, x )

# sol is(are) the value(s) of x that solve hprime(x) == 0
sol = sympy.solveset( hprime, x )
sol


# Above we see that the equation $h^\prime(x) = 0$ has two solutions: one negative and one positive. 
# Obviously, only the positive may be feasible for Alice. 
# And, since its value is between $0$ and $20$, it is indeed feasible. 
# 
# You may recall that the sign of the second derivative tells you whether the root of the first derivative is a *maximum*, a *minimum* or a *saddle point*.

# In[ ]:


opt = max(sol)
sympy.diff( hprime, x ).subs(x,opt).evalf()


# Since $h^{\prime\prime}(\mbox{opt}) > 0$ it is indeed a (local) **minimum**.

# ## With $\pi$ as a symbol

# In[ ]:


# now pi is a symbol, just like x
pi = sympy.Symbol('pi')

# we redefine h using the same right-hand-side code as before, 
# but now with x and pi as symbols
h = (4*pi*x**2 + 2000)/(8*pi*x+200)

# to have the drivative on the symbol pi we need it from the new version of h
hprime = sympy.diff( h, x )

solution = sympy.solveset( sympy.diff( h, x ), x )
solution

# That is the purpose of the next section.

# # What if we only care about the numerical solution?
# 
# ## Introducing `pyomo`
# 
# This is the moment to meet:
#  * mathematical models expressed in `python`, using `pyomo`,
#  * powerful numerical optimization algorithms and how to use them. 
# 
# We now meet [`pyomo`](http://www.pyomo.org/documentation/) which will keep us company for the rest of the course. 
# Note that in particular you may find this [slide-deck](https://software.sandia.gov/downloads/pub/pyomo/Pyomo-Workshop-Summer-2018.pdf) quite useful. 
# 
# We will see that `pyomo` completely separates modeling from solving, which allows us to switch solver without recoding! 
# 
# ## Notebook dependencies requiring installation on `colab`
# 
# Note that [this notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jckantor/ND-Pyomo-Cookbook/blob/master/notebooks/01.02-Running-Pyomo-on-Google-Colab.ipynb) explains how to run `Pyomo` on Google Colab. 
# For a complete overview please check the [cookbook](https://jckantor.github.io/ND-Pyomo-Cookbook/).

alice.pprint()


# We may solve the problem even if we have no solver installed!
# We simply call a solver on [neos](https://neos-server.org/neos/solvers/index.html) which `pyomo` treats as a _solver manager_.

alice.pprint()


# Besides `pprint`, `pyomo` objects also implement `display`. 

# In[ ]:

# The reason why `Alice` reports having no constraints is because we modeled the constraints as `bounds` on the variable.

# We may also examine the parts of the model, as the variables, objectives, etc.

# It is worth learning more about [magics](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html), try the magic `%time` above before `solve`.

# ## What difference does it make if we change solver?
# 
# Let us get our own copy of `ipopt`.
# We refer again to [this notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jckantor/ND-Pyomo-Cookbook/blob/master/notebooks/01.02-Running-Pyomo-on-Google-Colab.ipynb) explains how to run `Pyomo` **and how to install solvers** on Google Colab.

# # Conclusion
# 
# This notebook shows you how to solve Alice's problem: finding the most stable amount of water in a vase. 
# 
# You learned how to solve the problem analytically with `sympy`, how to use `matplotlib` to visualize the function and the optimum. And how to model Alice's problem on `pyomo` and solve it with `ipopt` both at [neos](https://neos-server.org/neos/solvers/index.html) and "locally" at your own Colab session.
# 

# # Last remarks
# 
# This notebook deferred installation of the packages needed to the moment that we actually needed them. 
# 
# This was deliberate, to show that - for instance - we could solve the problem on `neos` even _before_ having installed our first solver. 
# 
# Subsequent notebooks will tend to list all dependencies on their top part, which we often call the _preamble_.
