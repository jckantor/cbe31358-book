# ## Progress Report

# ## Outline for a final report
# 
# * Perform co-current and counter-current temperature measurements for the double pipe each exchanger.
# 
# * Compute $U$ for each experiment using LMTD formula.
# 
# * Attempt to analyze the data by plotting $1/U$ as outlined above. If this fails, consult Dr. Kantor for a second approach.
# 
# * Use the rating caculations to compare model to measured temperature profiles. 
# 
# * Answer this question:  Would the correlation developed for $1/U$ provide an accurate way of predicting the performance of the double pipe heat exchanger?
